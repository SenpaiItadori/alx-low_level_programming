By myself!!

I know, I know , i understand
I know, I know , i understand
They saw they know , they understand
I know , I know , I understand

Imagine seeing everything coming
forseeing the near future
I do sometimes
BUt it is not bcoz of devine manoeuvres

Ive lost all fun
but dont need saving
The past can't be undone
Hence the lost of all my cravings

Depressing t seems
i am a joyous boy
Not sad by any means
just disliking external ploys

but im not a rapper
lol

I wear a lot of hats 
But im not a capper
I spit hot fire
But im not a rapper

I send txt Messages
.... Without a keyboard
I slice and dice in ninja games
Without a ninja sword!!

oHHHHHHHH!

But im not a rapper
What in the world am i writing lmao.
